# Task 2: News Category Classification (AG News)

**Description:**  
This task involves classifying news articles into categories such as **Business, Sports, Politics, and Technology** using the AG News dataset. The goal is to predict the category of a news article based on its text content.

**Dataset:**  
- [AG News Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)  
- Contains labeled news articles from multiple categories.

**Libraries & Tools:**  
- Python, Pandas  
- NLTK (stopwords, tokenization, lemmatization)  
- Scikit-learn (TF-IDF, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM)  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn for visualization  

**Steps Performed:**  
1. **Text Preprocessing:**  
   - Lowercasing, stopword removal, punctuation removal, lemmatization.  
2. **Feature Extraction:**  
   - TF-IDF vectorization of article text.  
3. **Model Training:**  
   - Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM classifiers.  
4. **Evaluation:**  
   - Accuracy, F1-score, confusion matrix.  
5. **Bonus:**  
   - Visualized most frequent words per news category.  

**Outcome:**  
- Built an accurate multi-class news classification model.  
- Analyzed common keywords in each category to understand model predictions.
